# MetaheuristicOptimization

## Description
- In Function Optimization folder:
1. Random Search: Implemented a random search method as an optimizer, and tested it on the toy problems from main.py. The initialization point for the method is to be set to (x,y)=(15,15).
2. Gradient Descend: Implemented a gradient descend (or steepest descend) method as an optimizer, and tested it on the toy problems from main.py. The initialization point for the method is to be set to (x,y)=(15,15).
3. Newton-Raphson method: Descend: Implemented a Newton-Raphson method as an optimizer, and tested it on the toy problems from main.py. The initialization point for the method is to be set to (x,y)=(15,15).
